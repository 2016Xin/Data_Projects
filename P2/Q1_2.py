## 2. Explore the relationship between a player's salary and batting performance 
##    Pearson and Spearman Correlation are used to determine
##    the correlate between a player's batting performance and salary

#  2.1. Merge data with salary and batting performance into a new dataframe: df1
df1 = salary_data.merge(batting_data, on =['yearID','teamID','playerID','lgID'], how = 'inner')

#  2.2. Calculate batting average: BA = H/AB
#       Batting average: hits divided by at batsâ€”the traditional measure of batting ability
df1 = df1.dropna(axis=0, how='any',subset = ['AB','H','BB','HBP','AB','SF']) # rule out nan values
df1 = df1[df1['AB'] >=130] # rule out rookies
df1['BA'] = df1['H']/df1['AB']
    
#  2.3. Calculate On-base percentage: OBP
#       On Base Percentage is calculated by adding hits, walks, and hit-by-pitches 
#       and dividing by the sum of at bats, walks, hit by pitches, and sacrifice flies:
#       OBP=(H+BB+HBP)/(AB+BB+HBP+SF)
df1['OBP']=(df1['H']+df1['BB']+df1['HBP'])/(df1['AB']+df1['BB']+df1['HBP']+df1['SF'])
